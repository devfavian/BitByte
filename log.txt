- I learned how embeds work.
- I created the !Buserinfo command.
- I had troubles with reactions and role assignment.
- I learned how GuildMemberJoin works and, in general, what a Guild is.
- I created a welcome message feature.
- I created an auto-role assignment on member join feature.
- I improved code organization using utility classes.
- I explored permission issues related to role hierarchy.
- I tested real user joining behavior (with a friend).
- I practiced basic debugging using System.out.println().
- I moved the Command class from the commands package to utils for better management.
- I separated the packages into usercommands and admincommands.
- I created a new admincommands command, !Bclear, which deletes a specified number of messages from the channel.
- I converted the !Bhelp command list into an embed.
- Multiple fixes: resolved issues with !Buserinfo command for users without a nickname and other minor improvements.
- Created !Bavatar command to show the avatar of the command sender or a mentioned user in 1024px resolution.
- Fixed an issue where !bclear and !bavatar didn’t work when typed in lowercase.
- Created !Bservericon commad to show the icon of the server.

- Enhanced !Buserinfo to support mentioned users.
- Fixed username vs nickname display (uses account username + optional server nickname).
- Minor embed cleanups for clarity.
- Added !Bremind command: schedules reminders with embeds and user mention.
- Immediate confirmation + delivery embed using queueAfter(); includes Discord timestamps (<t:…>).
- I'm working on graphic style of embeds.

- Reworked the entire bot — commands now use slash commands instead of the ! prefix.
- Updated the Main class to include a debug system so changes are applied instantly (DEV MODE only).
- Implemented command completion suggestions along with validation limits to prevent users from entering invalid values.
- Added command descriptions to display during auto-completion.
- Encountered some difficulties with the /clear command.
- Had issues with /userinfo — fixed it by using getOption for the "member" as well, ensuring that all information is retrieved from the targeted user. Without this change, the bot was pulling some data from the command executor and some from the mentioned user, causing it to fail.
- I'm working on handling exceptions. Right now, the bot is unstable — for example, it will crash if you try to use it in DMs.
- Removed the prefix "B" before commands.
